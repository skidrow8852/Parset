Parset is a simple yet versatile programming language designed and implemented to practice and enhance my Python programming skills. It serves as a learning project and an exploration into how programming languages are built, parsed, and executed.

# Why Parset?

Parset was born out of curiosity and a desire to dive deeper into the inner workings of interpreters, compilers, and language design. It’s an experimental project aimed at understanding:

- **Lexical analysis:** Breaking down raw code into tokens.
- **Syntax parsing:** Understanding the structure of code.
- **Evaluation:** Executing instructions based on their semantics.
